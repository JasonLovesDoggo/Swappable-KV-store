## This is kind of a useless project as this has a bunch of code that other code invalidates, but i'm still building this to learn various databases and SQAlchemy

### todo add a db for mysql



### Adding a database
1. create the code for in databases/{database name}.py .e.g. redis.py
2. add it to utils/structures.py
3. add it to the comment in the config.ini file
